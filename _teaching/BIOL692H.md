[BIOL 692H](https://catalog.unc.edu/courses/biol/){:target='_blank'} is a course designed senior and senior biology majors aiming for Honors and Highest Honors. In this course, students learn the preparation of a written and oral presentation of honors thesis research.

I taught this course in Spring 2019 during my doctorate studies. A typical lab takes about 2 hours. The course instructor gives an introduction of that week's topic, such as writing an introduction for a research paper. Then, students start working on their research, either writing a research paper or on their honor's presentation, in guidance of their teaching asssistants.
