[BIOL 101L](https://catalog.unc.edu/courses/biol/){:target='_blank'} is an introductory Biology lab designed for freshman undergraduate students who study Biology. It is an examination of the fundamental concepts in biology with emphasis on scientific inquiry. Biological systems will be analyzed through experimentation, dissection, and observation.

I taught this course in Fall 2017 and Fall 2022 during my doctorate studies. A typical lab takes 2-3 hours. It starts with an introduction of that week's subject, such as PCR, and followed by the instructions about the experiments to be performed and performing of experiments by students. I prepared quizzes and exams with other teaching assistants and graded quizzes, exams, essays, and lab reports.
