[BIOL 278L](https://catalog.unc.edu/courses/biol/){:target='_blank'} is a lab designed for sophomore and senior undergraduates study in Biology. It teaches techniques of observation and experiments in animal behavior. Students design or conduct experiments in guidance of their teaching assistants to study the behavior of various invertebrates and vertebrates throughout the course. Students also learn and perform statistical analysis methods, such as Student's T-test, regression, and ANOVA, on the data they collected. 

I taught this course for 9 semesters from Fall 2018 to Spring 2022 during my doctorate studies. A typical lab takes 2-3 hours. It starts with an introduction of that week's subject, such as fish schooling, and followed by the instructions about the experiments to be performed and performing of experiments by students. I prepared quizzes and exams with other teaching assistants and graded quizzes, exams, essays, and lab reports.
