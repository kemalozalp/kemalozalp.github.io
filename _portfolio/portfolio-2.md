In this repo, you can find solutions to SQL questions on HackerRank. There are many repos on the internet for the solutions of these questions. I provided my own insights and unique solutions as much as I can. All my solutions are written in MySQL. So, make sure you select "MySQL" on HackerRank while answering questions.
