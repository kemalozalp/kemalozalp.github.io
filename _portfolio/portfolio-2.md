This repo demonstrates creating a database using MySQL. This is not my original work except the containerazation of the repository. You can find the original work on the Giraffe Academy website. That being said, I created the entity relationship (ER) diagram and database schema on my own and added some original queries in addition to the ones given in the course.

In this example, you'll find how a database is created from a document describing the database requirements and entity relationships. From this document, I created the ER diagram and database schema. Based on the database schema, I created the tables and inserted information into the tables. Finally, I queried the database using MySQL. In addition to the queries given in the course, I added some original queries to demonstrate a few extra things.

Finally, I created a Docker image to run database and query it on your own machine. Pleaes visit [my Github repo](https://github.com/kemalozalp/dockerized-SQL-database/blob/main/README.md) if you're interested in the code.
