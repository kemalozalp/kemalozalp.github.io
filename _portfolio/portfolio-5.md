I created a Jupyter notebook to demonstrate simple PySpark commands on multiple .csv files. I strictly followed PySpark tutorial from [FreeCodeCamp by Krish Naik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_C8kWso4ne4&t=5212s){:target='_blank'}. I have made a few changes here and there which seemed more efficient to me from coding perspective, but my work is not original. Please follow the [link](https://github.com/kemalozalp/pyspark-tutorial/blob/main/README.md){:target='_blank'} to my Github repository    .
