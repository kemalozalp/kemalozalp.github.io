A contrastive learning encoder inspired by Google's "Supervised Contrastive Learning" paper. I used the two papers from Google below:

[Unsupervised Contrastive Learning](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/chen20j/chen20j.pdf){:target='_blank'}
[Supervised Contrastive Learning](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2020/file/d89a66c7c80a29b1bdbab0f2a1a94af8-Paper.pdf){:target='_blank'}

The gist of this application is that I changed the contrastive learning loss to learn the positive class rather than learning all classes. Please redirect to my Github repo from the [link](https://github.com/kemalozalp/binary-contrastive-learning){:target='_blank'}.
